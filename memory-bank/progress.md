### 2026-06-23 - Hard block pending recovery routines

#### 완료한 작업

- Removed the same-day `missed_attendance` soft recovery exception from the web app.
- Removed the `lateStudyRecoveryRequests` UI path and `recovery-soft` styling.
- Added web behavior that ends an already-active session when pending recovery is detected, then opens the recovery modal.
- Added Supabase migration `20260623123718_hard_block_pending_recovery_requests.sql` so `start_study_session()` rejects any pending recovery request.
- Applied the migration to Supabase project `bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx` and verified the remote function definition no longer contains the missed-attendance exception.
- Updated recovery routine tests to cover the hard-block policy.
- Committed and pushed `b38118518c2ee8942a0eaded97087c0b79126cd9` to `origin/main`.
- Vercel production deployment `dpl_G83faqJ6ppEGU2grthT3TtTJUd7j` is `READY`.
- `https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app/` returned HTTP 200 and served `assets/index-DzLaOTTB.js`.

#### 남은 작업

- Refresh existing browser tabs before testing the recovery blocker because already-open tabs may still run older JS.

#### 다음 우선순위

- Production smoke-test with a pending recovery request: the app should auto-open the recovery modal, stop an active session, and keep `입장하고 시작` disabled until submission.

### 2026-06-23 - Session todo quick add

#### Completed Work

- Added a quick-add input to the session planning modal so users can create a today todo without pre-registering it in the calendar.
- Automatically selects the newly inserted todo for the pending study session.
- Changed the no-todos start path to keep the user in the session planning modal instead of redirecting to the full calendar todo modal.
- Added helper tests for quick-add title normalization and disabling the start button while the quick-add save is in progress.

### 2026-06-18 - Recovery prompt loop clarification

#### Completed Work

- Investigated why the app kept asking for a recovery routine after the user submitted one.
- Confirmed the submitted 2026-06-18 request was correctly marked `submitted` in Supabase.
- Confirmed an older 2026-06-17 `missed_attendance` recovery request for the same user remained `pending`, which continued to block study start.
- Changed automatic in-app recovery modal opening to use only blocking recovery requests.
- Added recovery modal date, request type, queue position, and remaining request count.
- Updated submit handling to mark the submitted request locally before dashboard reload and show the next remaining blocking request explicitly.

#### Next Priority

- In production, submit the remaining older recovery request or confirm the modal no longer appears once no blocking pending requests remain.

### 2026-06-18 - In-app recovery routine submission

#### Completed Work

- Added an in-app recovery routine modal for pending `study_recovery_requests`.
- The modal auto-opens after login when pending recovery exists and can also be opened manually from recovery blocker cards.
- Added authenticated Supabase RPC `submit_study_recovery_request` so the logged-in user can submit reason, makeup todo, and pledge directly from the web app.
- The RPC creates today's makeup todo and tomorrow's pledge todo, then marks the recovery request submitted.
- Updated Slack recovery PRD and implementation notes so Slack and app modal are both valid submission paths.

#### Changed Files

- Vercel production runtime error-log query returned no `error` or `fatal` logs in the checked 30-minute window.

#### Remaining Work

- Manual browser check with a real pending recovery request can confirm the modal opens automatically after login.

#### Next Priority

- If Slack interactivity still fails, use the in-app modal to unblock study and then inspect Slack signing-secret configuration separately.

### 2026-06-18 - Attendance missed despite perceived 20:59 start diagnosis

#### Completed Work

- Investigated why 2026-06-18 showed missed even though the user thought the app was turned on before 21:00 JST.
- Confirmed production `attendance_days` marked 2026-06-18 missed exactly at the 21:00 JST deadline.
- Confirmed production `study_sessions` has no 2026-06-18 session and no session near the 20:30-21:00 JST attendance window.
- Confirmed `daily_completed_study_seconds()` for 2026-06-18 returns 0 while the weekday goal is 7200 seconds.
- Identified the large displayed study time as likely stale/old session data, not a persisted 2026-06-18 study start.

#### Changed Files

- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- Supabase production SQL query for `attendance_days`, `study_sessions`, `study_recovery_requests`, and `study_presence_events`.
- Local code review of `start_study_session()`, `mark_missed_attendance()`, `end_study_session()`, and camera-required start flow.

#### Remaining Work

- Add UI safeguards so users can tell whether camera/app open has actually created a persisted study session.
- Consider cleanup or correction for older oversized session durations that still distort month totals.

#### Next Priority

- Implement clearer "session start saved" feedback and an alert when camera is on but no study session exists.

### 2026-06-17 - Two-hour session lease timer

#### Completed Work

- Added a two-hour session lease policy for web study sessions.
- The dashboard now shows a `세션 유지 남은 시간` countdown while a study session is active.
- Added a `세션 유지` button that extends the current active session by another 2 hours from the click time.
- If the lease expires, the web app automatically calls `end_study_session`.
- Lease overrun time is added to `p_excluded_seconds`, so forgotten time after the lease deadline is not saved as study time.
- Existing active sessions without a stored lease fall back to `started_at + 2 hours`, which lets abandoned previous-day sessions auto-end after the app loads.
- Today's study total now adds active elapsed time only when the active session's `local_date` equals today's local date.

#### Changed Files

- `https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app/` returned HTTP 200 and served `assets/index-B1_8AaYG.js` / `assets/index-BlOsAQsR.css`.
- Production JS asset contains `study-room-session-lease` and the keep-alive UI string.
- Vercel production runtime error-log query returned no `error` or `fatal` logs in the checked one-hour window.

#### Remaining Work

- Consider a future server-side stale-session cleanup for cases where the user never opens the web app again.

#### Next Priority

- Verify the countdown/keep-alive UI with a logged-in active session.

### 2026-06-16 - Slack recovery button signing diagnosis

#### Completed Work

- Investigated why Slack `회복 루틴 작성` button clicks did not work.
- Confirmed `slack-recovery-interactions` is deployed as version 2 and ACTIVE with `verify_jwt=false`.
- Confirmed recent Slack button requests reached the Edge Function but returned `401`, meaning request signature verification failed before modal handling.
- Confirmed Slack delivery itself works: recovery messages were recorded as `sent`, and a direct Slack test alarm to `C0BAFS1CSV8` returned `ok=true`.
- Confirmed `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` exists as a Supabase Edge Function secret, so the current failure points to a wrong Signing Secret value or a different Slack App than the one sending the interactive request.
- Added a cron-secret protected recovery routine test path to `slack-test-alarm` so a specific pending recovery request can be posted as a Slack button message without running full attendance cron.
- Deployed `slack-test-alarm` v7 to Supabase and sent a recovery routine test message to Slack channel `C0BAFS1CSV8`.

#### Changed Files

- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`
- `supabase/functions/slack-test-alarm/index.ts`
- `apps/web/test/slackNotifications.test.mjs`

#### Verification

- Supabase Edge Function logs showed three recent `POST | 401` entries for `https://bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx.supabase.co/functions/v1/slack-recovery-interactions`.
- Supabase SQL showed pending recovery request `df8694be-5eae-4529-adfe-d97942112542` has Slack channel `C0BAFS1CSV8` and message timestamp `1781613060.827019`.
- Supabase SQL `net.http_post` sent a Slack test alarm through `slack-test-alarm`; request id `13350` returned HTTP 200 with `ok=true` and Slack `messageTs=1781619471.681719`.
- `npx.cmd supabase secrets list --project-ref bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx` confirmed the `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` secret name exists.
- `node --test apps\web\test\slackNotifications.test.mjs` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed 127 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Supabase Edge Function list confirmed `slack-test-alarm` v7 ACTIVE with `verify_jwt=false`.
- Supabase SQL `net.http_post` sent a recovery routine test message through `slack-test-alarm`; request id `13360` returned HTTP 200 with `ok=true`, recovery request `df8694be-5eae-4529-adfe-d97942112542`, and Slack `messageTs=1781620002.856819`.

#### Remaining Work

- Replace `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` with the Signing Secret from the exact Slack App that owns the installed bot token and interactive messages.
- Confirm Slack App `Interactivity & Shortcuts` is enabled and Request URL is `https://bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx.supabase.co/functions/v1/slack-recovery-interactions`.

#### Next Priority

- After the signing secret is corrected, click the real Slack recovery button again and confirm the modal opens.

### 2026-06-16 - Weekday/weekend attendance goals and late study recovery

#### Completed Work

- Added a date-based attendance policy: weekdays require 2 hours of completed study, weekends require 4 hours.
- Set weekday reminders to use the saved profile reminder time with a `20:30` default, and weekend reminders to use fixed `14:00`.
- Added Supabase helper functions for daily study goal seconds, effective reminder time, completed study totals, and late-study attendance promotion.
- Updated `get_due_reminders()` and `mark_missed_attendance()` to suppress reminders or missed marking when the daily study goal is already complete.
- Updated `end_study_session()` so ending a session that reaches the daily goal promotes the day to `present`, even after an earlier `missed` status.
- Adjusted `start_study_session()` and the web UI so same-day `missed_attendance` recovery does not block late recovery study, while camera-repeat and old recovery requests still block.
- Updated Slack/Web Push/Email reminder bodies to mention the daily study-goal recovery path.
- Updated web and mobile UI copy to show weekday/weekend reminder and goal rules.

### 2026-06-16 - Editable scheduled recurring todos

#### Completed Work

- Added repeat metadata columns to `study_todos`: `repeat_group_id`, `repeat_mode`, `repeat_weekdays`, and `repeat_until`.
- Added constraints and an index so weekly recurring todos are grouped and single todos remain clean default rows.
- Added explicit Supabase Data API grants for authenticated access to `study_todos`.
- Added todo recurrence helpers for weekday normalization, weekly metadata detection, and repeat label formatting.
- Added edit support in the calendar todo modal: existing todos now prefill title, optional time, repeat mode, weekdays, and repeat end date.
- Added group update behavior for recurring todos: save updates existing dates, inserts newly selected dates, and deletes removed dates in the same repeat group.

### 2026-06-15 - Editable saved alarm settings UI

#### Completed Work

- Added a settings-screen `설정된 알람` card that shows the current daily reminder time, email fallback state, computer notification state, and Slack state.
- Added an `알람 편집` mode with time input, email fallback checkbox, `알람 저장`, and `취소`.
- Split simple alarm profile editing from the existing computer notification registration action so editing the time does not trigger browser push permission prompts.
- Moved Slack Channel ID save, computer notification registration, and Slack test alarm into a separate `알림 수단` card.
- Added a focused regression test for the editable alarm card wiring.

### 2026-06-15 - Camera status diagnosis UI

#### Completed Work

- Added a client-only camera diagnostic helper that maps browser support, permission, stream, frame, absence, loading, paused, and healthy states to a clear title, detail, and checklist.
- Wired the Today Focus camera card to track the latest camera diagnostic reason from `getCameraSupport`, `getCameraStreamHealth`, `getCameraFrameHealth`, permission errors, and upper-body absence timing.
- Rendered a compact camera diagnosis strip inside the existing camera monitor card without adding a separate modal or server-side media flow.
- Added regression tests for diagnostic copy/state mapping and UI wiring.

### 2026-06-15 - Today Focus camera UI simplification

#### Completed Work

- Removed the duplicate Today Focus timer from the camera-focused section so today's study time is shown through the top summary card only.
- Removed the duplicate normal camera status detail message while preserving guidance messages for starting, warning, and error states.
- Enlarged the camera preview and let the camera monitor card use the available content width.

#### Next Priority

- Verify the production camera card with an actual logged-in camera session and decide whether to add a user-facing camera health checklist for permission/device conflicts.

### 2026-06-15 - Camera stalled frame recovery

#### Completed Work

- Investigated the screenshot where camera monitoring showed `준비 중` and `카메라 영상을 불러오는 중입니다` while the timer kept running.
- Found that `no-current-frame` and `no-video-size` were treated as indefinite loading states.
- Added a camera frame recovery state machine for transient video frame loading failures.
- Added one automatic camera reconnect after 15 seconds of missing current frame/video size.
- Added a safe failure path after one reconnect attempt so the user can manually turn camera monitoring on again.

### 2026-06-14 - Slack setup UX, Kakao removal, refresh-safe timer, and camera resume

#### Completed Work

- Added a dedicated Slack Channel ID save action so the logged-in user can create/update their own `notification_targets.kind = 'slack'` row before sending a Slack test alarm.
- Removed Kakao OAuth/link UI helpers and removed Kakao Memo sending from the active `attendance-cron` path.
- Added migration `0018_disable_kakao_notifications.sql` to disable legacy enabled Kakao notification targets/connections while preserving historical rows and old delivery records.
- Changed page lifecycle session policy so `visibilitychange`, `pagehide`, and `beforeunload` no longer end active study sessions. This preserves running study time across refresh/reload.
- Added camera monitoring intent persistence and one-shot camera auto-restore for the same active session after refresh.
- Applied Supabase migration `disable_kakao_notifications` to project `bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx`.

### 2026-06-14 - Camera black preview false absence fixed

#### Completed Work

- Investigated the screenshot where the timer kept running, camera preview was black, and the app reported upper body absence.
- Added camera video health checks before PoseLandmarker absence detection.
- Treat missing, ended, muted, disabled, not-yet-ready, zero-size, or nearly black camera frames as camera errors instead of user absence.
- Reset absence timing when the camera feed is unhealthy so false black-frame absence does not continue to auto-pause the timer.
- Relaxed upper-body detection for cropped webcam views: head plus one shoulder and same-side hip now counts as seated presence.
- Clarified Slack missing-target text so it says the current account has no saved Slack Channel ID.
- Confirmed remote Supabase Edge Functions `attendance-cron`, `camera-presence-warning`, and `slack-test-alarm` are ACTIVE.

- `Select-String` checks for `memory-bank/ko`, `memory-bank/ja`, `/ko`, `/ja`

#### Remaining Work

- None for this documentation update.

#### Next Priority

- Future work inside the app repo should use `C:\jini-dev\project\study-room-attendance` as the working directory and read the app-local `AGENTS.md` plus app-local `memory-bank` documents.

### 2026-06-14 - Overnight scheduled todo save fixed

#### Completed Work

- Investigated why the todo modal did not close and the todo appeared not to save for a schedule like `23:00` to `01:00`.
- Found the frontend rejected `end_time < start_time`, and the remote Supabase `study_todos_time_window_check` constraint also required `start_time < end_time`.
- Changed the frontend rule so `end_time < start_time` is treated as an overnight schedule and only equal start/end times are rejected.
- Added Supabase migration `0017_allow_overnight_study_todo_times.sql` to allow same-day and overnight schedules while rejecting zero-length schedules.
- Applied remote Supabase migration `allow_overnight_study_todo_times`; the live constraint now checks `start_time <> end_time`.

#### Remaining Work

- None for this fix.

#### Next Priority

- If the modal still stays open, capture the browser console error and Supabase insert response for the exact logged-in user.

### 2026-06-14 - Scheduled recurring todo save display fixed

#### Completed Work

- Investigated why todos with weekday selection and time settings appeared not to save.
- Confirmed remote Supabase `study_todos` already has `start_time` and `end_time`, so the issue was not a missing database column.
- Fixed todo schedule formatting so Supabase `time` values like `09:00:00` render as `09:00`.
- Added save-focus behavior so if weekday repeat creates rows on dates other than the currently open date, the calendar moves to the first created date instead of leaving the visible list empty.

### 2026-06-14 - Vercel production deployment completed

#### Completed Work

- Pushed CI timezone fix commit `9e5b8d3` to `origin/main`.
- Confirmed GitHub Actions run `27500448036` completed successfully.
- Confirmed Vercel production deployment `dpl_AE995CdmFTzXne3qAdGV1fnBRfMz` is `READY`.
- Confirmed `https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app` returns HTTP 200.
- Confirmed Vercel production error log query for the last hour returned no matching error logs.

#### Changed Files

- `curl -I https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app`: HTTP 200
- Vercel production runtime logs, level error, since 1h: no logs found

#### Remaining Work

- Local direct Vercel CLI deploy still requires `VERCEL_TOKEN` or `vercel login`; current deploy path is GitHub Actions through `main` pushes.

#### Next Priority

- Treat Vercel production verification as the final step for future user-visible app changes.

### 2026-06-14 - Vercel deployment pipeline timezone fix

#### Completed Work

- Pushed commit `309481c` to `origin/main` to trigger the Vercel production GitHub Actions workflow.
- Confirmed workflow run `27500348234` failed in the `Run tests` step before deployment.
- Identified the CI-only failure as a timezone-dependent `reminderPopup` test.
- Fixed `apps/web/test/reminderPopup.test.mjs` to pass `timeZone: "Asia/Tokyo"` explicitly, matching the app's runtime call path.

#### Changed Files

- `apps/web/test/reminderPopup.test.mjs`
- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- `TZ=UTC node --test apps\web\test\reminderPopup.test.mjs`
- `npm.cmd test`

#### Remaining Work

- Push the timezone fix and confirm the next Vercel production workflow run succeeds.

#### Next Priority

- Verify the resulting Vercel deployment is `READY` and mapped to `https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app`.

### 2026-06-14 - Optional todo time and weekly recurrence verified

#### Completed Work

- Verified the todo creation modal supports optional start/end time entry.
- Verified the todo creation modal supports optional weekly repeat mode, repeat end date, and weekday selection.
- Confirmed repeated todos are materialized into `study_todos` rows for the selected dates.
- Confirmed duplicate prevention uses local date, normalized title, and optional time range, so the same title can be scheduled separately at different times.
- Confirmed `study_todos.start_time` and `study_todos.end_time` are covered by the time-window migration.

#### Changed Files

- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`

#### Verification

- `node --test apps\web\test\todoRecurrence.test.mjs apps\web\test\todoSchedule.test.mjs`
- `npm.cmd test`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- `git diff --check`

#### Remaining Work

- Production users will see this UI only after the current web app changes are deployed.
- A future version can store reusable recurrence rules if the app needs indefinite weekly schedules instead of materialized date rows.

#### Next Priority

- Deploy the current web build when the user wants the Vercel production URL updated.

### 2026-06-14 - Slack direct channel test succeeded

#### Completed Work

- Confirmed remote Supabase Edge Functions are active:
  - `slack-test-alarm` v4 ACTIVE
  - `attendance-cron` v14 ACTIVE
  - `camera-presence-warning` v5 ACTIVE
- Invoked `slack-test-alarm` through Supabase `net.http_post` with the cron secret from Vault and direct channel `C0BAFS1CSV8`.
- Verified response id `10391` returned HTTP 200 with Slack `ok=true`.
- The function returned `localDate=2026-06-14`, `todoCount=0`, and Slack `messageTs=1781442017.534459`.

#### Changed Files

- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`

#### Verification

- Supabase MCP `_list_edge_functions`
- Supabase SQL `net.http_post` to `/functions/v1/slack-test-alarm`
- Supabase SQL read of `net._http_response where id = 10391`

#### Remaining Work

- The direct channel test proves the Slack bot token, channel ID, bot membership, and Edge Function path.
- Scheduled reminders still require the logged-in user's app settings to save a user-scoped `notification_targets.kind = 'slack'` row.

#### Next Priority

- In the web app settings, save Slack Channel ID `C0BAFS1CSV8` and use the in-app Slack test button to verify the user-scoped target path.

### 2026-06-14 - Supabase auth session persists after refresh

#### Completed Work

- Confirmed the refresh-login bug was caused by the Supabase browser client setting `persistSession: false`.
- Added `authSession.mjs` to centralize Supabase Auth session options.
- Enabled `persistSession: true` and `autoRefreshToken: true` while keeping `detectSessionInUrl: false` for the app's manual OAuth callback flow.
- Added an initial session-loading state so the login form is not shown before `supabase.auth.getSession()` finishes restoring a stored session.
- Added regression tests for session persistence options.

#### Changed Files

- `apps/web/src/authSession.mjs`
- `apps/web/src/authSession.d.mts`
- `apps/web/src/supabase.ts`
- `apps/web/src/main.tsx`

- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- RED: `node --test apps\web\test\authSession.test.mjs` failed because `authSession.mjs` did not exist.
- GREEN: `node --test apps\web\test\authSession.test.mjs` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed 80 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.

#### Remaining Work

- Production Vercel still needs redeployment before the deployed URL keeps sessions across refreshes.
- Strict session lifetime or inactivity timeout should be configured in Supabase Auth session settings if required.

#### Next Priority

- Deploy the web app when the user wants production updated, then verify refresh keeps the user on the dashboard.

### 2026-06-14 - Tab switching no longer ends study session

#### Completed Work

- Confirmed the active-session bug was caused by treating `visibilitychange: hidden` as a page-exit event.
- Added a `shouldEndStudySessionForPageEvent()` helper so exit-event decisions are tested outside React.
- Updated the dashboard to send the keepalive `end_study_session` request only for `pagehide` and `beforeunload`.
- Kept tab switching as valid study time; camera monitoring is no longer intentionally stopped by a tab switch.
- Added regression coverage that proves `visibilitychange` does not end the study session while `pagehide` and `beforeunload` still do.

#### Changed Files

- `apps/web/src/main.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/sessionExit.mjs`
- `apps/web/src/sessionExit.d.mts`
- `apps/web/test/sessionExit.test.mjs`

- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`
- `memory-bank/prd-camera-presence.md`
- `memory-bank/implementation-plan.md`

#### Verification

- RED: `node --test apps\web\test\sessionExit.test.mjs` failed before implementation because `shouldEndStudySessionForPageEvent` was not exported.
- GREEN: `node --test apps\web\test\sessionExit.test.mjs` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed 78 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.

#### Remaining Work

- The production Vercel app still needs a deployment if this local change should be reflected on `https://study-room-attendance.vercel.app`.

#### Next Priority

- Deploy the web app when the user asks for production update, then verify the production bundle contains the new session-exit behavior.

### 2026-06-14 - Slack token alias and direct channel test

#### Completed Work

- Added Slack bot token fallback support for `STUDY_ALERT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` while preserving `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.
- Updated `slack-test-alarm` so cron-secret protected calls can send a direct test message to a provided `channelId`.
- Redeployed Supabase Edge Functions:
  - `slack-test-alarm` v4 ACTIVE
  - `attendance-cron` v14 ACTIVE
  - `camera-presence-warning` v5 ACTIVE
- Sent a direct Slack test alarm to channel `C0BAFS1CSV8`; Supabase `net._http_response` returned HTTP 200 and function content returned `ok=true`.

#### Changed Files

- `supabase/functions/slack-test-alarm/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/attendance-cron/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/camera-presence-warning/index.ts`

- `packages/core/test/sql-migrations.test.mjs`
- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- `npm.cmd test`
- `npm.cmd run build`
- Supabase Management API deploy responses confirmed ACTIVE function versions.
- Supabase SQL `net.http_post` invoked `slack-test-alarm` with `channelId = C0BAFS1CSV8`; response id `10360` returned HTTP 200 and Slack `messageTs`.

#### Remaining Work

- Scheduled Slack reminders still require a user-scoped `notification_targets.kind = 'slack'` row saved from the web app settings.
- Cross-user confirmation of whether `C0BAFS1CSV8` is already saved was rejected by security review and should not be retried without user-scoped context.

#### Next Priority

- Ask the user to save Slack Channel ID in the app settings, or provide the specific account identifier if server-side target setup is requested.

### 2026-06-14 - 반복 할 일 선택형 시간 설정

#### 완료한 작업

- 할 일 등록 모달에 `시간 없음` / `시간 설정` 토글과 시작/종료 시간 입력을 추가했다.
- `시간 설정`을 켠 경우 시작/종료 시간을 검증하고, 종료 시간이 시작 시간보다 늦을 때만 저장하도록 했다.
- 요일 반복 등록 시 선택한 시간 범위를 생성되는 모든 날짜의 todo에 함께 저장하도록 했다.
- 같은 날짜와 제목이라도 시간 범위가 다르면 별도 todo로 등록될 수 있게 중복 판단을 변경했다.
- 오늘 할 일, 알림 팝업, 완료 이력에 시간 배지를 표시하도록 했다.
- `attendance-cron`과 `slack-test-alarm`이 todo 시간 범위를 Slack/WebPush/이메일 알림 본문에 포함하도록 변경했다.
- 원격 Supabase 프로젝트 `bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx`에 `20260614115454 study_todo_time_window` migration을 적용했다.

### 2026-06-14 - 알림 시간 이전 활성 세션의 입장 알림 억제

#### 완료한 작업

- 웹 인앱 리마인더 팝업 조건을 `shouldShowStudyReminderPopup` helper로 분리했다.
- 같은 날짜에 `active` 공부 세션이 있으면 알림 시간이어도 "독서실 입장 시간입니다" 모달을 표시하지 않도록 했다.
- Supabase `get_due_reminders()`가 알림 시간 이전 시작 세션이 `reminder_at`을 지나 열려 있으면 `attendance_days.status = 'present'`로 보정하고, 초기/재촉 알림 대상에서 제외하도록 했다.
- Supabase `mark_missed_attendance()`가 결석 처리 전에 pre-reminder 세션이 `reminder_at`을 걸쳤는지 확인하고, 해당 pending 행은 `present`로 보정하도록 했다.
- 원격 Supabase 프로젝트 `bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx`에 `20260614114124 pre_reminder_active_session_attendance` migration을 적용했다.

### 2026-06-14

#### 완료한 작업

- 카메라 감시가 꺼진 상태에서는 `입장하고 시작`이 바로 Supabase `start_study_session` RPC를 호출하지 못하도록 차단했다.
- 카메라가 꺼져 있으면 `카메라 인증이 필요합니다` 팝업을 띄우고, `카메라 켜고 시작`을 눌렀을 때만 카메라 권한 요청 후 공부 세션을 시작하도록 했다.
- 활성 공부 세션 중 카메라 감시가 꺼져 있으면 앱 팝업을 다시 띄우고 `camera_required_warning` 이벤트를 Edge Function으로 보낸다.
- `camera_required_warning` Telegram 경고는 10분 쿨다운을 적용해 중복 발송을 막는다.
- `study_presence_events.event_type` check constraint에 `camera_required_warning`을 추가하는 migration을 만들고 원격 Supabase에 적용했다.
- `camera-presence-warning` Edge Function을 version 2 ACTIVE로 배포했다.
- 커밋 `e726c34`를 `origin/main`에 push해 GitHub Actions Vercel production 배포를 실행했다.
- GitHub Actions run `27472648244`가 성공했고, Vercel production URL이 최신 카메라 필수 시작 UI 번들을 서빙하는 것을 확인했다.
- 5분 이상 상반신이 감지되지 않으면 현재 세션 타이머가 자동 일시정지 상태가 되고, 해당 미감지 구간은 오늘 공부 시간과 현재 세션 시간에서 제외되도록 했다.
- 상반신이 다시 감지되면 제외 시간을 누적하고 현재 세션 타이머가 다시 진행되도록 했다.
- 10분 이상 상반신이 감지되지 않으면 세션을 자동 종료하고, `end_study_session` RPC에 `p_excluded_seconds`를 전달해 DB 저장 시간에서도 제외되도록 했다.
- 페이지 이탈 자동 종료 요청도 `p_excluded_seconds`를 전달하도록 수정했다.
- `end_study_session` RPC를 `p_excluded_seconds integer default 0` 인자로 확장하는 migration을 만들고 원격 Supabase에 적용했다.
- 커밋 `a461228`를 `origin/main`에 push해 GitHub Actions Vercel production 배포를 실행했다.
- GitHub Actions run `27473367753`이 성공했고, Vercel production URL이 최신 카메라 자동 일시정지/자동 종료 UI 번들을 서빙하는 것을 확인했다.
- 얼굴만 감지하던 `FaceDetector` 기반 카메라 감시를 `PoseLandmarker` 기반 상반신 감지로 교체했다.
- 머리 랜드마크 1개 이상과 좌우 어깨 랜드마크가 일정 confidence 이상이면 사람이 앉아 있는 것으로 판단하도록 했다.
- 상반신 감지 순수 함수와 앱 연결 테스트를 추가했다.

- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- RED: `node --test apps\web\test\mobileTheme.test.mjs` failed because `color-scheme` meta was missing.
- GREEN: `node --test apps\web\test\mobileTheme.test.mjs` passed.
- `npm.cmd test` passed 34 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.

#### Remaining Work

- Deploy to Vercel after a valid Vercel token or login is available.
- Confirm on the actual mobile browser after deployment.

#### Next Priority

- Continue the medium-force habit system design after the mobile theme fix is visible on the user's phone.

### 2026-06-12

#### Completed Work

- Continued brainstorming the next medium-force study habit system.
- Chose to treat timer starts between T+15 and T+30 as `present`.
- Chose 2 nudge reminders before final missed handling.
- Chose Telegram absence reason collection with category buttons plus optional note.
- Updated the latest Telegram-linked user's Supabase profile reminder time from `21:00:00` to `20:30:00` in `Asia/Tokyo`.

#### Changed Files

- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`

#### Verification

- Supabase profile query before update returned `reminder_time=21:00:00`.
- Supabase profile update returned `reminder_time=20:30:00`.
- Supabase profile query after update returned `reminder_time=20:30:00`.

#### Remaining Work

- Write a design spec for the medium-force habit system.
- Implement T+15 nudge, T+30 final missed threshold, and Telegram absence reason webhook after the design is approved.

#### Next Priority

- Decide the exact Telegram wording and button categories for nudge and absence-reason messages.

### 2026-06-11

#### Completed Work

- Diagnosed why the configured 21:00 local reminder did not send to Telegram or computer Web Push.
- Confirmed Supabase Cron was active and returning HTTP 200 every minute.
- Confirmed the latest enabled Telegram target has `reminder_time = 21:00:00` and `time_zone = Asia/Tokyo`.
- Confirmed the 2026-06-11 21:00 local cron window returned `dueReminderCount:0` and created no notification delivery rows.
- Found the root cause: a 2-second study session at 2026-06-11 01:39:36 local had already marked the day `present`, so `get_due_reminders()` excluded the user at 21:00.
- Added migration `0009_start_session_attendance_window.sql` so `start_study_session()` only marks attendance `present` inside the reminder-to-deadline window.
- Applied the migration to Supabase project `bqohkdzvxbrokkmuhysx` with MCP `_apply_migration`.
- Verified the remote function definition contains the reminder-window guard.

#### Changed Files

- `supabase/migrations/0009_start_session_attendance_window.sql`
- `packages/core/test/sql-migrations.test.mjs`
- `memory-bank/active-context.md`
- `memory-bank/progress.md`
- `memory-bank/implementation-plan.md`
- `memory-bank/trouble-shooting.md`

#### Verification

- Remote migration history includes `start_session_attendance_window`.
- Remote SQL check returned `function_guard=True`.
- Remote cron check returned `study-room-attendance-cron schedule=* * * * * active=True`.
- 21:00 local cron window had 5 HTTP 200 responses and all returned `{"dueReminderCount":0,"missedCount":0,"deliveryResults":[]}`.
- 21:00 local notification delivery window had 0 delivery rows.
- `node --test packages\core\test\sql-migrations.test.mjs` passed 6 tests.
- `npm.cmd test` passed 33 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.

#### Remaining Work

- If Vercel production must receive local file changes, rerun deployment after Vercel credentials are available.

#### Next Priority

- Test tomorrow or set a near-future reminder to verify that Telegram/Web Push send normally when the day has not already been marked `present`.
